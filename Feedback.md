Hello Vitaly & Alex,

Here's my feedback on your project. I've included some points for preservation and some points for improvement. I hope you find it helpful.

Your Python part review:

Let's break down the feedback on your students Alex & Vitaly's project 'Driving theory test'. To start, I'll commend the areas where they did well and follow it with the points that need improvement.

### Points for Preservation:
1. **Consistent Structure**: The overall structure of the code is consistent, making it easier to follow.
2. **Use of Django Features**: Excellent use of Django's Models, Forms, and APIViews, demonstrating a solid understanding of how to structure a Django application.
3. **Commenting**: The `# Create your models here` and `# clean it up!` comments indicate places for future improvement, showing a conscious decision-making process.

### Points for Improvement:
1. **Variable Naming**: While it's mostly fine, some variables like `apiCodes` could be improved to adhere to Python's PEP 8 style guide, such as `api_codes`.
2. **DRY Principle**: The code inside the `FillDB` class could benefit from more functions to avoid repetition. For example, the loop body could be encapsulated in a separate function.
3. **Use of `print` Statements**: I noticed a `print` statement in the `ImageAPIView`. It's a good practice to remove these or replace them with logging.
4. **Image Link Validation**: In the `ImagesOfQuestions` model, you're storing the image link as a CharField with `null=True`. You might want to add some validation here.
5. **Better Exception Handling**: The code could be more resilient if it included better exception handling, particularly in network operations like API requests.
6. **API Key Storage**: It's not a good practice to store API keys directly in the code. Consider using environment variables for better security.

Your 'Driving Theory Test' project's JavaScript code is well-structured and functional. That said, I'd like to point out some aspects that could make it even better.

### Points for Improvement:

1. **Error Handling**: While you've included some error handling, consider having a user-facing message in case of errors, rather than just `console.log`.

2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: The `displayImg` function appears twice with the same logic. Also, similar logic is used to create different elements in the DOM. Try to create a more generic function to handle these tasks.

3. **Comments and Documentation**: Though you have some inline comments, a bit more explanation about what each function and variable does would make the code more readable.

4. **Hardcoded URL**: The URL for API calls is hardcoded. This may make it less flexible when deploying the app. Consider moving it to a configuration file or using environment variables.

5. **Code Modularity**: Functions like `renderExam` and `showQuestion` are quite large and do multiple things. Consider breaking them down into smaller functions with single responsibilities.

6. **Use of Global Variables**: Try to minimize the usage of global variables. It's generally considered better practice to pass them as arguments to functions.

7. **Type Comparisons**: While comparing with numbers (`if (--timer < 0)`) or doing string interpolations, it's good to be explicit about types to avoid unexpected type coercion.

### Points for Preservation:

1. **Async-Await Syntax**: Good use of `async/await` for handling promises.

2. **DOM Manipulation**: You've done a great job creating, appending, and manipulating DOM elements dynamically.

3. **Function Decomposition**: You've broken down the tasks into multiple smaller functions, which is good for readability and debugging.

4. **Code Organization**: Logical grouping and ordering of functions make the codebase easy to navigate.

Overall, this is a strong project. However, focusing on these points of improvement will make it even better. Keep up the good work!
